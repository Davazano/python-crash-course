 # Letâ€™s say we want to create a higher-order function that takes as input some function f
 # and returns a new function that for any input returns twice the value of f:
def doubler(f):
    def g(x):
        return 2 * f(x)
    return g
 
# This works in some cases:
def f1(x):
    return x + 1

g = doubler(f1)
print g(3)          # 8 (== ( 3 + 1) * 2)      
print g(-1)         # 0 (== (-1 + 1) * 2)

# However, it breaks down with functions that take more than a single argument:
def f2(x, y):
    return x + y
g = doubler(f2)
print g(1, 2)    # TypeError: g() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)

# What we need is a way to specify a function that takes arbitrary arguments. We can
# do this with argument unpacking and a little bit of magic:
def magic(*args, **kwargs):
    print "unnamed args:", args
    print "keyword args:", kwargs

magic(1, 2, key="word", key2="word2")
# prints
#  unnamed args: (1, 2)
#  keyword args: {'key2': 'word2', 'key': 'word'}

# That is, when we define a function like this, args is a tuple of its unnamed arguments
# and kwargs is a dict of its named arguments. It works the other way too, if you want
# to use a list (or tuple) and dict to supply arguments to a function:
def other_way_magic(x, y, z):
    return x + y + z

x_y_list = [1, 2]
z_dict = { "z" : 3 }
print other_way_magic(*x_y_list, **z_dict)   # 6

# You could do all sorts of strange tricks with this; we will only use it to produce
# higher-order functions whose inputs can accept arbitrary arguments:
def doubler_correct(f):
    """works no matter what kind of inputs f expects"""
 
    def g(*args, **kwargs):
        """whatever arguments g is supplied, pass them through to f"""
        return 2 * f(*args, **kwargs)
    return g

g = doubler_correct(f2)
print g(1, 2) # 6
